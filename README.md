<h2>Inventory Manager</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>An ASP.NET web app that allows users to store inventory items with quantities
and vendor information. These will be linked together so that users can create
and send orders for inventory to the vendor. Item usage can be tracked and used
to aide with orders.</p>

<p>Users can create an account, and administrators can grant permissions so data
can be kept private. Categories are created for each item to allow them to be
grouped for convenience of updating quantities. </p>

<p>This app was created to help small business managers that place frequent orders
to easily keep track of quantities on hand. It also provides an easy solution to
getting an order to a vendor without a cumbersome telephone exchange that sometimes
lead to miscommunication and errors.</p>
